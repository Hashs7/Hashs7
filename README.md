# 👋 I'm Sébastien,
a passionate frontend developer living in the vibrant city of Barcelona 🇪🇸    

Currently, I'm weaving magic in the digital realm as a proud member of [Kraken Technologies](https://github.com/octoenergy).

## 🌱 About me

I'm a tech artisan with a commitment to building a sustainable and renewable future. With a deep respect for the environment, I weave my code with the threads of eco-consciousness, ensuring that the digital experiences I craft leave the smallest possible ecological footprint and raise awarness.
As a frontend developer, I specialize in turning complex ideas into intuitive interfaces using JavaScript spells. I'm particularly adept at wielding the latest frameworks and libraries to create modern, responsive, and performant web applications.
